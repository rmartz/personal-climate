# Climate
This is a project that uses the Azavea Climate Change API to present localized climate projections, interpreted and presented in a way to hopefully help individuals gain a more direct understanding of what a 3.6F rise in global average temperature really means.

## Development server
If not already installed, install the Angular CLI tool with `node install -g @angular/cli`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
