  Currently on average the hottest {{hottest_n}} days in a year reach a high above {{ static_percentile.current | number : '1.0-1' }} {{static_percentile.units}}. In the {{ static_percentile.future_era }}s, it's expected that {{ current_threshold.future | number : '1.0-1' }} days a year will reach that temperature, and the hottest {{ hottest_n }} days of each year in the {{ static_percentile.future_era }}s may rise above {{ static_percentile.future | number : '1.0-1' }} {{ static_percentile.units }} - something only {{ future_threshold.current | number : '1.0-1' }} days in a year do now.
